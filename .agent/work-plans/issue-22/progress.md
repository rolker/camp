# Issue #22 — Import generic vector data

## Issue Review
**Status**: complete

**Issue**: #22
**Comment**: (best-effort post follows this entry; not recorded inline)
**Scope verdict**: needs-more-detail

### Actions
- [ ] Reconcile with the existing `VectorDataset` / `camp::vector::parseVectorLayers` code (`src/camp/vector/vectordataset.{h,cpp}`, `src/camp/vector/vector_parse.{h,cpp}`): this already opens arbitrary OGR vector files (GeoJSON, shapefile, etc.), RAII-closes the GDAL handle (issue #152), and builds Point/LineString/Polygon items — but into the editable MissionItem/Group tree, not a `map::Layer`. The issue's Related section omits it entirely. State explicitly whether #22 (a) reuses/extends `parseVectorLayers` for the new read-only layer (recommended — avoids re-deriving OGR iteration; "only what's needed"), (b) supersedes `VectorDataset`, or (c) is a deliberately separate concept (editable-import vs. read-only-display) — and why.
- [ ] `ParsedGeometry`/`ParsedLayer` (`vector_parse.h`) currently carry **no attribute fields at all** — attributes are dropped during parsing. The issue's "Must have" list (attribute-driven styling, click-for-attributes) requires extending this struct/parse path; scope that work explicitly in the plan rather than assuming "just wire up styling to existing data."
- [ ] `VectorDataset::write()` persists the source filename but `VectorDataset::read()` is an empty stub — the persisted file is never restored on project reload today. The new layer's "Must have: persist by path + style" is exactly the feature quietly broken in the sibling code; note this so a reviewer doesn't assume the existing persistence path can be copied as-is.
- [ ] The issue asks to both "mirror RasterLayer" (a single async-loaded Layer that paints one composited surface, per ADR-0007) and support "click a feature → its attributes." RasterLayer has no per-feature hit-testing; `VectorDataset`'s approach (one QGraphicsItem child per feature) gets Qt's native item-picking for free but doesn't fit a single async field-source layer. Pick and state the architecture (custom hit-testing in one Layer vs. per-feature child items) during plan-task — the issue is silent on this fork and it drives the whole implementation shape.
- [ ] The "reusable colormap facility (#63)" reference is stale: `camp::map::ColorMap` (the facility #63 originally scoped) was deleted in camp#141/PR#144 (ADR-0008) and replaced by the external `marine_colormap` library, already integrated in `RasterLayer` and `ros/grids/grid_map.cpp` (`marine_colormap::find_palette` + `palette->sample()`). This is good news, not a blocker — the real facility already exists and is in active use — but #22 should cite `marine_colormap` / ADR-0008 directly, and #63 (still open) looks like a stale tracking issue worth closing as superseded in a follow-up.
- [ ] No tests are mentioned in the issue's scope, despite this area's strong precedent (`test_raster_layer_gdal_cleanup.cpp`, `test_color_map.cpp`, `test_catalog_source.cpp`) and the "Test what breaks" principle. Plan-task should scope: attribute-parse extension tests, the thread-safe-teardown test mirroring `ros/geometry/polygon.h`'s #213 pattern (join-worker-in-destructor), and colour/size-by-field mapping tests.
- [ ] Consider phasing: load+render+persist+teardown as an MVP slice, attribute-driven styling + click-popup as a follow-on — the combined "Must have" list is large for one PR (six distinct capabilities). Not blocking; a recommendation for plan-task.
- [ ] ADR-0003's depth-tree / Z-order model and ADR-0011's viewport-clip convention should be checked against the new layer's paint path once the architecture fork above is resolved — flag if per-feature rendering needs viewport clipping for larger vector sets (the two cited test datasets are tiny — 33 and 7 features — but the issue frames this as general-purpose, and future consumers like survey-index footprints could be much larger).


## Plan Authored
**Status**: complete
**When**: 2026-09-14 10:48 -04:00
**By**: Claude Code Agent (Claude Sonnet)

**Plan**: `.agent/work-plans/issue-22/plan.md` at `75182fc`
**Branch**: feature/issue-22 at `75182fc`
**Phases**: single

### Open questions
- [ ] Persistence mechanism: plan resolves "persist in the project file" (issue wording) to ADR-0003 §4's app-state (QSettings) pattern like RasterLayer/backgrounds, since VectorLayer is a Layers-tab layer, not a mission item — the operator's six decisions didn't explicitly settle this; confirm at review-plan.
- [ ] Menu/action wiring location ("Open vector layer") to be confirmed against the existing "Open background" action during implementation.
- [ ] `ParsedGeometry::attributes` container type (QMap<QString, QVariant> vs. ordered vector-of-pairs) — defaulted to QMap; revisit only if display order matters.

## Plan Review
**Status**: complete
**When**: 2026-09-14 10:53 -04:00
**By**: Claude Code Agent (Claude Opus)

**Plan**: `.agent/work-plans/issue-22/plan.md` at `75182fc`
**PR**: PR-less (dispatched `--issue 22`, branch `feature/issue-22`)
**Verdict**: changes-requested

Dimension verdicts — Scope: good. Issue alignment: good (all six operator
decisions honoured). File targeting: concern (library-layering link error;
three missing files). Consequences: concern (removal/de-persist path absent;
one consequence row rests on a false premise). Documentation & instruction
impact: good (present and non-silent). Principle alignment: needs work
("verify against source, never document from assumptions" — step 2's premise
is wrong; "a change includes its consequences" — de-persist missing). ADR
compliance: good (ADR-0002/0003/0008 correctly applied; 0007/0011 correctly
excluded). ROS conventions: N/A (pure Qt/GDAL, ADR-0002 ROS-free boundary).

Verified against source: `marine_colormap` API (`find_palette` /
`palette->sample(t)` clamped to [0,1] / `to_rgba8` → `Rgba8`) as used in
`grid_map.cpp:152-219` — plan's usage is correct. `RasterLayer`'s async shape
(`QFutureWatcher` + `abort_flag_`/mutex, `waitForFinished()` in the dtor,
synchronous `initExtent`) — correct. The camp#213 join-in-destructor pattern in
`ros/geometry/polygon.h` — correct. `ParsedGeometry`/`ParsedLayer` carry no
attributes — correct. `VectorDataset::read()` is an empty stub — correct, but
see finding 1 for what that actually means.

### Findings
- [ ] (must-fix) Step 2's premise is false: a persisted `VectorDataset` IS restored on project load — `missionitem.cpp:185` dispatches `object["type"] == "VectorDataset"` to `AutonomousVehicleProject::openGeometry(filename)` (`autonomousvehicleproject.cpp:200-214`), which constructs and `open()`s the dataset. `readChildren` creates no `VectorDataset` item, so `read()` is never called and the planned "restore filename + call open()" fix would be dead code (and a double-load if an item were also created). Re-scope item 3 to the defect that is actually there — `openGeometry` inserts into `m_currentGroup`, not into the node's own parent, so a nested `VectorDataset` is restored at the wrong place — or close it as not-a-defect-as-described with the evidence. The operator's decision 3 was made on this false premise and needs one line of re-confirmation before implementation — `plan.md:58-65`
- [ ] (must-fix) The consequences row "previously-empty `VectorDataset` nodes now populate on reload" is wrong for the same reason and must not reach the PR description as a behavior-change claim — `plan.md:243`
- [ ] (must-fix) Library layering: `src/camp_map/vector/vector_layer.cpp` would live in the `camp_map` SHARED library, but `camp::vector::parseVectorLayers` is compiled only into the `CCOMAutonomousMissionPlanner` executable (`CMakeLists.txt:135`). `.agents/README.md` states the rule explicitly — "code in a library cannot call into the executable that links it" (the libcamp_crash lesson, #217). Either move `vector_parse.{h,cpp}` into `camp_map` (it is pure Qt/GDAL and ROS-free, so it belongs there; `VectorDataset` then includes it from there) or keep `VectorLayer` in the executable's sources. Decide in the plan, not at link time — `plan.md:67-69, 204-205`
- [ ] (must-fix) The async load worker must call `camp_crash::install_thread_alt_stack()` as its first statement — enforced by the `check_worker_alt_stacks` CTest guard (`CMakeLists.txt:554`), which fails CI for any `QtConcurrent::run()` entry point that omits it (`raster_layer.cpp:189` is the pattern). Not mentioned anywhere in the plan — `plan.md:70-75`
- [ ] (must-fix) Persistence is missing its removal half. `RasterLayer::onRemovedFromMap()` (`raster_layer.cpp:749-757`) and `AutonomousVehicleProject::onChartLayerRemoved` (`autonomousvehicleproject.cpp:322+`, wired to the Map model's `rowsAboutToBeRemoved`) exist precisely so a layer removed from the Layers tab stays removed across restarts (camp#90/#117). Step 6 plans only persist/restore, so a removed vector layer would come back on next launch. Add the `onRemovedFromMap()` override plus the model-removal bookkeeping, and mirror `test_background_persistence.cpp`'s `RemoveDePersistsAndSticks` coverage — `plan.md:132-158, 160-186`
- [ ] (must-fix) Styling math has no degenerate/absent-value handling: a field whose values are all equal divides by zero, and a feature missing the field, or holding a non-numeric or NaN value, has no defined colour/size. `grid_map.cpp:200-206` handles exactly this case for grids. Specify the behaviour and test it — `plan.md:112-126, 171-178`
- [ ] (must-fix) The reused parser drops geometry it does not name: `vector_parse.cpp:86-140` switches on raw `getGeometryType()` and handles only `wkbPoint`/`wkbLineString`/`wkbPolygon`. Multi-part geometries (`wkbMultiPolygon` etc., routine in shapefile and KML) and every 25D variant (a GeoJSON point with an elevation is `wkbPoint25D`) fall through `default: break` and vanish silently. The issue claims shapefile/GeoPackage/KML "come free from the driver"; as written they do not. Either add `wkbFlatten` + multi-part handling in step 1, or state the limitation in the plan and PR and file the follow-on — `plan.md:47-56`
- [ ] (must-fix) Click-to-inspect is unspecified against the view that owns the mouse. `ProjectView::mousePressEvent` (`projectview.cpp:57-196`) runs the add-waypoint/trackline/survey modes on left-press and then forwards to `QGraphicsView::mousePressEvent` unconditionally, with `setDragMode(ScrollHandDrag)` in pan mode. Define what a left-click on a feature does in pan mode and in each add-* mode, so the attribute popup neither fights the hand-drag nor fires while the operator is placing waypoints — `plan.md:102-107`
- [ ] (must-fix) Three files missing from "Files to Change": `src/camp_map/map/item_types.h` (a new `VectorLayerType` enum entry — every `Layer` subclass declares one, `item_types.h:22-48`), `src/camp/mainwindow.cpp:161` (the startup `restorePersistedVectorLayers()` call, alongside `restorePersistedBackgrounds()`), and the `.agents/README.md` architecture note the plan itself proposes — `plan.md:197-215`
- [ ] (suggestion) Per-layer style settings key on `itemID()`, which derives from `objectName()` = the file's basename. Two vector files with the same basename in different directories would share one settings group. `GggsTileLayer` overrides `settingsKey()` for exactly this reason (camp#126, `map_item.h:56-61`); consider the same here — `plan.md:142-146`
- [ ] (suggestion) Latent lat/lon inconsistency in the parser you are extending: the Point path builds `QGeoCoordinate(getY(), getX())` when untransformed, while `readRing` builds `(getX(), getY())` — so line and polygon vertices from a source with no spatial ref are swapped. Pre-existing and out of scope, but worth confirming while the attribute work is in that file, since the acceptance test is a coordinate check — `vector_parse.cpp:96-104` vs `:46`
- [ ] (suggestion) Open Question 1 (persistence) — recommend **keep QSettings app state** per ADR-0003 §4: a Layers-tab layer is not mission data, and the operator's intent ("the layer returns when the project reopens") is met, since `mainwindow.cpp:161` restores layers at startup. But the plan's stated reason is inaccurate — the operator's decision 6 does repeat "save/restore in the project file" verbatim, so this is not an item their answers left silent. Put it to the operator as one explicit yes/no before implementation rather than treating ADR precedent as having settled it — `plan.md:147-153, 253`
